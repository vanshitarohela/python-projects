# Hangman Project Description

Inspired by the Hangman game we all have played at least once, this project is made with over 200+ words to keep the game exciting with 6 chances given to correctly guess the word.
It also includes some amazing ASCII arts to make the user experience better. 

# Module required
The random module (in-built Python module) has been used. We use the random module to randomly choose a word for the user to guess.
