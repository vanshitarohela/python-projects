# Caesar Cipher Project Description
Caesar Cipher is a popular kind of encryption and decryption technique, where in encryption the letter gets shifted to the right by a certain number and is replaced by the letter pointed at after shifting.
For example if the letter is 'A' and shift number is 3, then 'A' is replaced by 'D'.

Almost the same logic goes for decrypting the already encrypted text in which case the shift is done in the left direction.
Inputting the same shift number used for encrypting, decrypts the text effortlessly.
Here, if shift number is again 3, the 'D' would get replaced by 'A' to reveal the original text.

The project also involves amazing ASCII art to enhance the experince.
