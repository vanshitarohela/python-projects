# Number Guessing Game Project Description
In this project, the computer randomly decides a number between 1 and 100 and the user has to correctly guess that random number.
It has 2 game mode, 'easy' that gives you 10 chances to guess the number and 'hard' that gives you 5 chances to do the same.
The computer gives you hints about whether your guess is higher or lower from the random number, which could give user an idea about the interval in which the number exists.

## Modules Required
It uses two modules that come in-built with Python. The method 'randint' was imported from 'random' module to randomly decide the number and module 'os' was imported to clear the screen after each game so the previous game doesn't confuse the user.
