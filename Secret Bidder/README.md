# Description

This project named Secret Bidder, outputs who won the auction with the bid amount. The main feature in a Secret Bidding is that users will not be able to see what other prople have bid on the item.
The one with the maximum bid fianlly wins the auction.

## OS and Time libraries
The OS library has been used to clear the screen if there is another person waiting to bid so they wouldn't be able to see the previous bids.

The Time library's method "sleep" has been used to wait for a second before clearing the screen so the clearing of the screen isn't fast enough to make it seem a bit hasty.
