# BlackJack Game Project Description
Inspired by the Blackjack Game, this project is made to give the user the pure Blackjack game feel.
It also includes ASCII art to make the experience better.

## Modules Required
The modules required came in-built with Python. They were 'random' module to pick random cards and the 'os' module to clear the screen after every game so the previous game doesn't confuse the user with their new match.
